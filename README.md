# Psionic Meter v1.0 🌟

The Psionic Meter is a web-based application designed to explore potential consciousness-mediated influences on random number generation. This project provides a real-time visualization system for investigating and quantifying possible psychokinetic effects through a precise, high-frequency sampling approach.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Psionic Meter creates a closed-loop system between human consciousness and random number generation, offering:

- High-precision 60Hz sampling
- Real-time statistical analysis
- Interactive visual feedback
- Standardized testing protocol
- Robust data collection

## 🧪 Theory & Research Background

The project builds upon several key areas of research:

1. **Consciousness-Matter Interaction**: Studies have suggested that consciousness might influence quantum-scale events, potentially affecting random number generation.

2. **Bio-Electronic Effects**: Recent research has demonstrated instances where biological entities influenced electronic systems. For example, studies have shown rats affecting robot movement patterns in statistically significant ways.

3. **Statistical Deviation Analysis**: The system analyzes deviations from expected random distributions, looking for patterns that might indicate consciousness-mediated effects.
